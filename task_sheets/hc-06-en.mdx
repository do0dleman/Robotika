# Bluetooth module HC-06

## Theory

HC-06 is a simple Bluetooth module that is used for short-range wireless communication (less than 100m) that can be used with many microcontrollers and is easy to setup. The main flaw of HC-06 is its inability to work with iOS devices because it doesn't support Bluetooth LE (Low Energy).

The HC-06 module has 4 pins:
* RXD: Sends data **to Arduino from HC-06**. 3.3V logic. (RxD = Receive Data)
* TXD: Sends data **to HC-06 from Arduino**. 3.3V logic (TxD = Transmit Data)
* VCC: Power 5V.
* GND: Ground.

> HC-06 module uses 3.3V logic but arduino uses 5V logic. That means that if you want to send data from arduino to HC-06 you have to use **voltage divider** to drop signal voltage from 5V to ~3.3V. Nevertheles, arduino can read 3.3V digital signal, so no need to boost voltage of signal coming from HC-06 to arduino.

To communicate with HC-06 using smartphone we will use Arduino Bluetooth Controller ([paly market](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.giristudio.hc05.bluetooth.arduino.control)).

In these tasks you will only use HC-06 to receive data from the phone, so you won't need to connect RXD port to Arduino. However, if you want to send data to a connected device or want to configure HC-06 using [AT command,](https://www.instructables.com/AT-command-mode-of-HC-05-Bluetooth-module/) you will have to use RXD pin.

## Task 1. Setting up the module

The easiest way to use HC-06 with Arduino is to use [SoftwareSerial](https://docs.arduino.cc/learn/built-in-libraries/software-serial/) library. Download the library and upload the given code into Arduino. 

```c++
#include <SoftwareSerial.h>

SoftwareSerial BTSerial(2, 3);

void setup() {
  // Start serial comunication between PC and Arduino
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("up and running:");
  
  // Start serial comunication between HC-06 and Arduino
  BTSerial.begin(9600);
}
  
void loop() {
  // BTSerial.available method returns
  // number of bytes available for reading
  if(BTSerial.available() > 0){
    // We send data as characters but 
    // BTSerial.read by default returns integers
    // So we excplicitly convert the integer to a character
    Serial.println((char)BTSerial.read());
  }
}
```

> In this code example we must convert int to char to get 0 or 1. The main difference between char and int is that char represents a character, it may be '1' or 'A' or '@', but integer represents a number. However, under the hood char is also a number, but it represents **a character assigned to this number**. In Arduino characters are encoded according to [ASCII Table](https://www.techonthenet.com/ascii/chart.php). For instance char '1' is represented by number 49, char 'A' by number 65.

Open Arduino Bluetooth Controller, connect to the hc-06 module and select LED/Lamp Control (should be the first option). It should print 0 or 1 on button click.

### Criteria Table

|       Criteria                               | Yes | No | Partly |
| -------------------------------------------- | --- | -- | ------ |
| The HC-06 is connected correctly             |     |    |        |
| Serial monitor prints 0 or 1 on button click |     |    |        |


## Task 2. LED Control

Modify the code from the task 1 so it toggles a LED on and off on a button click.

| Can explain how the code works                               |     |    |        |

## Task 3. Multiple LED Control

Write a code that controls 3 LEDs using "Switches" in the Arduino Bluetooth Controller app.

> Consider using `BTSerial.readString` instead of `BTSerial.read`. Basically `BTSerial.readString` method reads the incoming characters, waits until the transfer of data will stop and sends the whole data as a string. `BTSerial.readString` is slower than `BTSerial.read` but a lot easier to use.
