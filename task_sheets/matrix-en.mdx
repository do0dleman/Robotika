# 8x8 dot matrix module with Max7219 controller
  
## Theory

Led Matrix is a relatively simple construction, just a bunch of LEDs. But if you want to control the whole matrix with Arduino, you will have to use a lot's pins to control all the LEDs. To minimize the amount of wires you can use a driver designed specifically for this purpose. In case of our 8x8 dot matrix this driver is called Max7219. 

Max7219 driver allows us to control 64 LEDs using only 3 wires for communication with Arduino (another 2 for power). What's even better, we can chain these drivers and control even more LEDs still using only 3 wires for communication.

Working with Max7219 driver using bare Arduino can be quite complicated. However there is an already-written library that will take care of all the hard parts of communication with it, it is called [LedControl](https://github.com/wayoda/LedControl).
## Task 1. Getting the LedControl library

Install the library via Arduino IDE. Go to "Sketch" -> "Include Library" -> "Manage Libraries..."

![lib installation guide](/images/lib-install.png)

Enter LedControl in the search field and download the first result.

![lib installation guide](/images/lib-manager.png)

The library must show up in contributed library section under the Arduino libraries section.

### Criteria Table

|       Criteria                      | Yes | No |
| ----------------------------------- | --- | -- |
| LedControl is showed as "installed" |     |    |

## Task 2. Getting the matrix working

![Circuit-8x8-LED-Matrix-Arduino](/images/matrix-pinout.webp)

Connect LED matrix to Arduino according to constants in a sketch provided below (you can change them if you want). Load the sketch into Arduino to make sure that everything works. It should run over all LEDs in the matrix and blink them.

```c++
#include <LedControl.h>

const int DIN = 10;
const int CS  = 11;
const int CLK = 12;

LedControl lc = LedControl(DIN, CLK, CS, 0);

void setup() {
  // Display setup
  lc.shutdown(0, false);
  lc.setIntensity(0, 0);
  lc.clearDisplay(0);
}

void loop() {
  // Run over all leds and blink them
  for(int j = 0; j < 8; j++) {
    for(int i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
      lc.setLed(0, j, i, true);
      delay(100);
      lc.setLed(0, j, i, false);
    }
  }
}
```

> `lc.setLed` method accepts 4 parametrs:
> * addr - adress of the display (in this case 0 because we have only 1 display)
> * row - x coordinate of the pixel (from 0 to 7) 
> * col - y coordinate of the pixel (from 0 to 7) 
> * state - LED state as boolean (true = on, false = off)

### Criteria Table

|       Criteria                                               | Yes | No | Partly |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | --- | -- | ------ |
| The matrix module is connected correctly                     |     |    |        |
| The matrix LEDs blink one after another                      |     |    |        |

## Task 3. Turning on pixels by coordinates

Write a programm that turns on the pixels using `lc.setLed` in a pattern as shown on the image below. The pixel in the top left corner has coordinates (0, 0) and is on.

| ------------------------------------------------------------ | --- | -- | ------ |
| The matrix module is connected correctly                     |     |    |        |
| The matrix LEDs are on as shown on the image                 |     |    |        |
| Can explain how the code works                               |     |    |        |


## Task 4. Bitmaps

In previous example we used `lc.setLed` function to change state of a single LED. It works fine but when we want to draw an image it is reasonable to use bitmaps to store image data instead. We can use `lc.setRow` function to set a row by an 8 bit or 1 byte number.

Load this code and try to understand what happens.

```c++
#include <LedControl.h>

const int DIN = 10;
const int CS  = 11;
const int CLK = 12;

LedControl lc = LedControl(DIN, CLK, CS, 0);

const byte Cat[8] = {
  B10001000,
  B11111000,
  B10101000,
  B01110001,
  B00100001,
  B01111001,
  B01111101,
  B10111110
};

const byte Apple[8] = {
  B00011000,
  B00001000,
  B01110110,
  B11111111,
  B11111111,
  B11111111,
  B01111010,
  B00110100
};

void setup() {
  lc.shutdown(0, false);
  lc.setIntensity(0, 0);
  lc.clearDisplay(0);
}

void loop(){
  for(int i = 0; i < 8 ; i++) {
    lc.setRow(0, i, Apple[i]);
  }
  delay(5000);
  lc.clearDisplay(0);
  for(int i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
    lc.setRow(0, i, Cat[i]);
  }

  delay(5000);
  lc.clearDisplay(0);
}
```

> Letter B in front of a number means that the number is written in binary format, for instance, B101 is 5.

Now try drawing your own bitmap and add it as 3rd image in this code example. You can use this [Bitmap Drawer](/en/tools/bitmapDrawer).

## **Task 6*. Bouncing screensaver

On many DVD players there is a screensaver where DVD logo bounces from one part of the screen to another. Try implementing something simmilar with 8x8 LED matrix. Make the block with size 1x2 pixels.
